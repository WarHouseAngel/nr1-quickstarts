The Quickstart app allows you to quickly and easily import some great dashboards into your New Relic accounts.

To import a dashboard, open the app and select one from the list. If you're looking for something specific you can use the search to find what you need.

When you've selected a quickstart, you will find a description, and list of requirements on the left. If you select the account where you want to import a dashboard Quickstarts will automatically check your requirements and provide links if you're missing any.

When you're ready to import a dashboard you can find a list on the right. Click on the "Import" button, select the account where you want to import the dashboard into, and click import.

That's it. If you have feedback, ideas, or problems with the widget, don't hesitate to reach out on Github.
